Games and Tournaments
47. Gamer  Responsible for Website Connection. It is the responsibility of each Gamer  to ensure that he or she has sufficient technical resources to access the MagiQlub Website.

48. Disconnection of Participant. If a game is a live, multiple-player game, a Gamer  who becomes disconnected and remains disconnected for a reasonable period of time (which would be disclosed at the beginning of the game) may be treated as having resigned from the game. If a game is not a live game, a Gamer  who becomes disconnected for any period of time will be treated as having resigned from the game. At the option of MagiQlub (but consistent within the specific tournament), the resignation (or disconnection) of a Gamer  from a tournament, for scoring purposes, MagiQlub will either: (1) treat the Gamer  as though he had not left any unanswered questions unanswered; (2) treat the Gamer  as though he had not taken any further actions in the game in which he or she was participating; (3) provide a zero score to the Gamer ; or (4) provide the minimum score in the game to the Gamer .

51. Event Timing. For all game events, both live and casual, the time recorded by the MagiQlub system servers shall represent the time of record. In all instances of timing, the time MagiQlub system records the start and end time of all events. In the case of a tie, the time calculated at the MagiQlub system is the final authority. Live Event play requires the player to submit responses to the server where time of submission becomes an important factor. Due to the inherent delays that can occur due to a player’s Internet or cellular connection, the MagiQlub system time is used as the authoritative time and is used for establishing the user’s submittal time.

Legal Rights, Notices, and Limitation of Liability
52. Recordkeeping. MagiQlub encourages all its Gamer  to keep complete and accurate records of all their business dealings for tax and accounting purposes

Any false, deceptive or misleading claims regarding the Business Opportunity or product/service are prohibited. Gamers occasionally, in violation of the rules of MagiQlub, represent hypothetical income figures based upon mathematical calculations of the power of network marketing as actual income projections. This is counterproductive, and prohibited, since new Gamers may be quickly disappointed if their results are not as rapid as the hypothetical model. If a Gamer  is uncertain as to the accuracy of any calculations or income projections presented, Gamer  should contact MagiQlub for additional information. Even though a Gamer  may witness another party making false, deceptive, misleading, or hypothetical calculations of income, this provision is not waived and the Gamer  is not permitted to engage in such activity.

Persons may not opt-out of certain emails specific to their MagiQlub account, except by cancelling their MagiQlub account.

55. No Governmental Endorsement. Federal and state regulatory agencies do not approve or endorse direct-selling programs. In some instances, the MagiQlub program may be registered with a state or federal agency. Registration does not represent or imply endorsement by that agency and does not mean that agency has undertaken any investigation of the MagiQlub program. Therefore, Gamers may not represent or imply, directly or indirectly, that the MagiQlub program has been approved or endorsed by any governmental agency.


56. Amendments. MagiQlub reserves the right to amend this Agreement, its prices, product availability, and Compensation Plan as it deems appropriate, so long as all Amendments apply equally to all Gamers. Generally, Amendments are effective for all Gamers as of the effective date stated in the Amendment; however, in the event that, because of applicable law or practical implementation issues, an Amendment cannot be applied to all Gamers immediately, such Amendment will be applicable to each Gamer  on that Gamer ’s annual renewal date. Amendments will be communicated to all Gamers through MagiQlub publications, through its Website, or by electronic means. This provision does not apply to the arbitration clause found in the Terms of Use, as that clause can only be modified by mutual consent.

57. Non-Waiver Provision. No failure of MagiQlub to exercise any right under this Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by a Gamer  with any obligation or provision herein and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of MagiQlub”sright to demand exact compliance with this Agreement. Waiver by the Company can only be made in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. MagiQlub”swaiver of any particular default by a Gamer  shall not diminish or impair MagiQlub”srights with respect to that default, if it is continuing, or any subsequent default, nor shall it diminish or impair in any way the rights of MagiQlub with respect to any obligations of any other Gamer .

58. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, including these rules and regulations, or any specification or operating procedure which MagiQlub has prescribed is held to be invalid or unenforceable under law or rule of any applicable jurisdiction, MagiQlub shall have the right to modify the invalid or unenforceable provision to the extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable. The Gamer  shall be bound by any such modification. The modification will be effective only in the jurisdiction in which it is required.
